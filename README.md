This is a MySQL Project.

## Project Overview
The data I have is from Car Dekho Company (India's leading car search venture). The dataset includes details of cars that were sold during the period from 1994 to 2023, including car name, year sold, selling price, km driven, fuel type, etc. This project aims to extract the required information from the old cars available for sale data.

A few of the queries asked are:
